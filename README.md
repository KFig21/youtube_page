<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This project was built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project's</a> HTML/CSS curriculum. The goal of this project was to learn how to embed videos as well as re-create a youtube page with HTML & CSS. Personally, I wanted to use React so I didnt have to recreate a lot of elements but this project is for HTML/CSS so I stuck with the basics</p>
