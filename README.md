# youtube_page

- Made for The Odin Project curriculum
- Re-create a Youtube page by embedding a YouTube video and styling the page with HTML and CSS
- (Personally, I wanted to use React so i didnt have to recreate a lot of elements but this project is for HTML/CSS so I stuck with the basics)

<h3> Things I'm proud of: </h3>

- The accuracy of the UI re-creaction
- Using advanced CSS techniques instead of JS
- Responsive design

<h3> Things I need guidance with: </h3>

- I still have a lot to learn about CSS, this project helped improve my skills
