# Embedding Videos and Images Project

<p><a href="https://kfig21.github.io/youtube_page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the project here!</a> ðŸ‘€</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This project was built for The Odin Project HTML/CSS curriculum. The goal of this project was to learn how to embed videos as well as re-create a youtube page with HTML & CSS. Personally, I wanted to use React so I didnt have to recreate a lot of elements but this project is for HTML/CSS so I stuck with the basics</p>
